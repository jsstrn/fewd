# Getting Started

We recommend that you complete the following tasks **before** the start of the course.

## Perseverance

In the first minute of this short clip, Steve Jobs shares with us the secret to success - passion. Without passion you wouldn't have the stamina to stay on this long hard road to becoming a web developer.

> It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions about your own capabilities. You are fine â€” you just need to keep at it. Take a break, reread some material, and always make sure you read and understand the example programs and exercises. **Learning is hard work, but everything you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier**.

This excerpt from the book [Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a favorite of mine and something I try to remember whenever I am learning something new.

## Dash by General Assembly

There are plenty of online resources for learning web development. We recommend that you complete the [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) online tutorials before starting the course.

## GitHub

We'll be using GitHub throughout this course, so you should create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account before we begin. Watch this short video series on [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4LFz8DZ0t-89twnelpT4Ilw) to learn more about GitHub.

## Let's chat

Naturally, you'll have a lot of questions that you'll want answered. In this course we'll be using the [Discourse](https://qna.fewd.site) platform for discussions and questions. Sign up for an [account](https://qna.fewd.site) using your GitHub credentials. We'll cover how to use this platform during the course.

We also have a Slack channel that you should have been added to by now. If you haven't, let us know and we'll add you in as soon as possible.
